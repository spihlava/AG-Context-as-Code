# Product Context

## Vision
A simple Tic-Tac-Toe game implementation to test the Antigravity Protocol in action.

## Core Value Proposition
Validates the protocol with a well-defined problem domain that has clear requirements and testable outcomes.

## Maturity: Alpha

## Target Users
- **Primary**: Protocol developers testing the framework
- **Secondary**: Future users learning from the example

## Success Criteria
- [ ] Game logic correctly implements Tic-Tac-Toe rules
- [ ] Players can make moves through a basic interface
- [ ] Win/draw conditions are properly detected
- [ ] Code follows the protocol workflow (Architect → Builder → Reviewer → Tester)

## Out of Scope (for now)
- AI opponent
- Multiplayer networking
- Advanced UI/animations
- Score tracking or persistence

## Key Constraints
- Keep it simple (Alpha maturity - speed over polish)
- Must demonstrate all protocol roles
- Clear documentation of workflow
